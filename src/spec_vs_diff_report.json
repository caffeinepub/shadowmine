  "summary": "REQ-25 and REQ-26 appear implemented (Down touch control removed; HUD text updated to exclude Down). Keyboard behavior changes for REQ-23/REQ-24 are indicated but cannot be fully verified from the truncated WorldGrid diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Update keyboard movement so the player moves left while ArrowLeft is held and moves right while ArrowRight is held; releasing the key stops movement; pressing the opposite direction reverses movement immediately.",
      "reason": "WorldGrid.tsx is truncated before the keyboard event handling / movement tick logic, so the diff summary does not provide direct evidence that (1) movement continues while the key is held, (2) releasing stops movement, and (3) opposite-direction press immediately reverses direction while the other is held.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-24",
      "requirement": "Update keyboard controls so ArrowUp triggers jump only (no vertical step movement) and remove any ArrowDown/S key behavior so Down no longer causes any player movement.",
      "reason": "WorldGrid.tsx is truncated before key mapping logic, so there is no direct evidence in the provided diff that ArrowDown and/or S have been fully disconnected from any movement action, nor that ArrowUp only triggers jump.",
