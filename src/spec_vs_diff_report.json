  "summary": "All three requested frontend requirements (REQ-13 hotbar UI, REQ-14 auto-loot on block break only, REQ-15 HUD text update) appear to be implemented via a new Hotbar component, new client-only inventory state/helpers, mining result propagation (blockBroken) from mining -> WorldGrid -> GameScreen, and updated HUD copy.",

    {
      "description": "Added/expanded jump + gravity mechanics (player jump state, gravity tick intervals, jump height constants) beyond the hotbar/inventory and auto-loot scope.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about hotbar-only inventory + auto-loot mined blocks + HUD text; it explicitly lists non-goals and does not request new movement physics like jump/gravity tuning.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/game/WorldGrid.tsx",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (mentions \"jump/gravity tuning parameters\" in constants and \"jump/gravity physics\" in WorldGrid)"
