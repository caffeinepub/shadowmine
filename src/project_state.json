  "summary": "2D block-mining/crafting game MVP expanded to include placing mined blocks from the hotbar into empty tiles, and a responsive hotbar UI positioned at the top of the screen with different sizing on desktop vs mobile.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Start with a minimal MVP (dirt+stone only); add crafting/shops/resources later in incremental updates.",
    "Mining rule: a block is mineable only if at least one of its 4 sides (up/down/left/right) touches air; after mining, the new air cell reveals and enables mining of adjacent blocks.",
    "Player is a simple movable marker for now (not a full stick-figure character).",
    "Inventory MVP decision: no separate inventory screen; mined blocks/items are automatically added directly into a simple visible hotbar.",
    "Camera: classic follow-camera. Keep player centered while within world bounds; camera moves at same speed as player and clamps to world edges while player can continue moving until they hit the world boundary.",
    "Block placing UX: player selects a block type from the hotbar, then clicks/taps an empty (air) tile to place it.",
    "Hotbar UI layout: position at the top of the screen and keep it visible on both desktop and mobile; scale size by device (desktop bigger, mobile smaller).",
    "Controls update: keyboard uses Left/Right for horizontal movement and Up for Jump; remove any Down movement/control (and corresponding on-screen Down button on touch).",
    "Movement feel: holding Left/Right continues moving; releasing stops; pressing the opposite direction switches immediately."

  "known_issues": [
    "Bug: player can currently \"fly\" (move upward freely); upward movement should be restricted to a jump action only."
